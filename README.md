# Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project demonstrates a basic machine learning workflow for predicting diabetes status (Pima Indians dataset) using a Logistic Regression classifier implemented in Python with pandas and scikit-learn.

# Overview
The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset contains information about female patients of Pima Indian heritage. This script loads the data, trains a machine learning model, and makes a binary prediction (Diabetic or Not Diabetic) based on the patient's medical features.

#Technologies and Libraries
Python 3
pandas: For data loading and manipulation.
scikit-learn (sklearn): For implementing the Logistic Regression model.
